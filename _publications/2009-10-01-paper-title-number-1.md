 excerpt: 'This paper is about the neuronal ensembles engaged in the pathogenesis of stress-induced depression. Utilizing activity-dependent viral strategies in mice, we identified a small population of stress-responsive neurons, primarily located in the middle part of the lateral hypothalamus (mLH) and the medial part of the lateral habenula (LHbM). These neurons serve as “starter cells” to transmit stress-related information and mediate the development of depression-like behaviors during chronic stress. Starter cells in the mLH and LHbM form dominant connections, which are selectively potentiated by chronic stress. Silencing these connections during chronic stress prevents the development of depression-like behaviors, whereas activating these connections directly elicits depression-like behaviors without stress experience. Collectively, our findings dissect a core functional unit within the LH-LHb circuit that mediates the development of depression-like behaviors in mice.'
